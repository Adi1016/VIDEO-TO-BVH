2) Minimum Requirements for the default configuration
   CUDA (Nvidia GPU) version:
   NVIDIA graphics card with at least 1.6 GB available (the nvidia-smi command checks the available GPU memory in Ubuntu).
   At least 2.5 GB of free RAM memory for BODY_25 model or 2 GB for COCO model (assuming cuDNN installed).
   Highly recommended: cuDNN.
   OpenCL (AMD GPU) version: Vega series graphics card
   At least 2 GB of free RAM memory.
   CPU-only (no GPU) version:

8) CLONE MOCAPNET FROM THE OFFICIAL GIT REPO: https://github.com/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET

9) NOW WE NEED TO PLACE SOME MODELS IN THE DIRECTORY DOWNLOAD THE FILE NAMED AS DATASET AND UNZIP IT IN THE MOCAPNET CLONED DIRECTORY
   DATASET: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CLtbgVPITkfOAh6tYUEiTpic99Rnfc0x/view?usp=sharing
